## Hi there!

This is a boilerplate you can use to start developing your Shopify theme using Liquid, Tailwind CSS, Cypress (to ensure your theme features are working properly,) and the latest Shopify standards to develop a theme.

## How to use
To use this repository for making Shopify themes, use the following command of Shopify CLI.

```bash
shopify theme init [ NAME OF YOUR THEME ] --clone-url https://github.com/gonzalo-novak/shopify-theme-boilerplate.git

If you don't have Shopify CLI installed to your computer, navigate to the installation page of Shopify CLI.
